# TRIKL - Social Media With Sustainable Engage & Earn

## Introduction
TRIKL is a mobile-first social platform that rewards users everytime they engage with content, thus boosting bloggers' engagement while empowering them with data ownership using Blockchain & Decentralized Data Storage. 

TRIKL also enables creators to convert their post into NFTs, host everything on decentralized storage networks, form exclusive communities / chat rooms. All this without the need of any native token/NFT to run its reward system. Hence, we can achieve greater flexibility, partner with any and every web3 platform, distribute rewards in their mode of choice, and our true value is not affected by market sentiments. However, there are plans to launch tokens in the future, basis community feedbacks. 

## Problem
Being creators ourselves and having helped 100s of creators, we observed that Low Engagement is the most crucial problem for creators globally. The current platforms neither guarantees data ownership nor helps creators with boosting engagement, charge astronomically high commissions, and don’t provide any incentive to readers.  

Creators extensively rely on giveaways to boost their engagement, and giveaways are preferred over paid advertisements in most cases. In fact, the world's most successful content creator - Mr. Beast, built $10B+ empire primarily using giveways. However, currently, creators are independently running giveaways, and it’s highly inefficient with no way of measuring genuine engagement.

## Solution Details
We planned the solution around 3 key objectives:
1. Data Ownership for users - Content stored on decentralized storage networks
2. Efficient Transactions - Blockchain Multi-chain (Polygon, Shardeum, Ethereum, more integrations soom)
3. Ease of Usage - A super user friendly mobile application with gamified and rewarding experience


## Challenges we ran into
We ran into following challenges: 
- Lack of good WiFi especially slowed our development process
- 

## Technologies we used
Solidity, Filecoin, Valist, StackOS, Polygon, Shardeum, Typescript, Ionic Framework, React, Ethers
Solidity, Typescript, Node.js, React, Ionic Framework, Shardeum, Polygon, IPFS, Filecoin, Web3.Storage, Ethers, Valist, StackOS, Lens Protocol, Wagmi, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, EJS


## Future Plans
- Improve the interface, audit and launch private beta
- Integrate with all wallets, social graph protocols
- Onboard writers and empower them by building their decentralized communities
- Implement glicko 2 algorithm for rewards distribution
- Add feature to convert posts to NFT
- Launch other content formats - text, image, audio and video, etc.
